# Altrompy

**Altrompy** (a play on *Entropy*) is the customized, professional-grade boilerplate used as the foundation for all **Altron-generated** projects. It is built on the Laravel/Livewire Starter Kit and enhanced with Flux Pro components, providing a battle-tested starting point for modern SaaS applications.

## 🚀 Overview

Altrompy serves as the "seed" or "progenitor," ensuring every new project managed by Altron starts with a consistent, high-quality structure. Whether you're building a dashboard, a creative tool, or a management system, Altrompy provides the essential building blocks.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Laravel 12 & Livewire 3**: The latest and greatest full-stack framework pairing.
- **Flux Pro UI**: Premium, accessible, and beautiful UI components out of the box.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Built-in support for Admin, Organization, and User roles.
- **SaaS Ready**: Includes standard SaaS pages (Landing, Dashboard, Settings, Profile) and layouts.
- **AI-Enhanced Workflow**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with AI coding assistants for rapid development.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Clean, modular structure that is easy to extend and customize.
