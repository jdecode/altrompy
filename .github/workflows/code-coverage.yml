          The latest code coverage analysis shows that our coverage is below the required threshold.

          **Current Coverage:** ${COVERAGE}%
          **Required Threshold:** ${THRESHOLD}%
          **Gap:** $(echo "$THRESHOLD - $COVERAGE" | bc -l)%

          ## Action Required

          Please increase the code coverage by at least 1% by:

          1. Adding tests for untested code paths
          2. Improving existing test coverage
          3. Removing unused/dead code

          ## Coverage Report

          The detailed coverage report is available in the [workflow artifacts](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}).
